    "In his very first model (which is scarcely visible now), Fabien tried to predict directly the `CLAIM_TYPE` field using a Random Forest classifier in some new features such as `VIP_SELLER`, `BUYER_REGION`, `SAME_REGION_BUYER_SELLER`, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "As I didn't know where to start, I decided to use the same feature set, but with a $k$-neighbors classifier. The results were worse. One problem of this approach is that the `-` level in the `CLAIM_TYPE` field is by far the most present (around 50% of orders did not lead to a claim); therefore when using 10 or 5 neighbors, `-` wins quite often (even when using `weights='distance'`). Knowing that, I tried to remove randomly from the training set a proportion of `-` : this led to better results both in the validation set and on the submitted test set; and confirmed that the problem was indeed due to the  fact that the classes are not well-balanced. However, removing randomly elements from the training set is not satisfactory and requires some knowledge on the testing set (which are not supposed to have).\n",
    "\n",
    "In my second attempt, I splitted the problem into two subproblems that ought to be simpler:\n",
    "- claim vs non-claim prediction;\n",
    "- claim kind prediction.\n",
    "I used a Random Forest to predict the presence of a claim and a KNeighborsClassifier to predict the claim type. \n",
    "I used the same features as before.\n",
    "This led to a significant improvement on both the validation set and testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to improve the results with the same configuration using a custom metric defined as a Python function for the KNeighborsClassifier (the `metric` parameter of the class). This was too slow to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then decided to change the features used with the KNeighborsClassifier. Indeed some features were encoded in a single variable using integers which implied a deceiving proximity between some levels. For example, the `WARRANTLIES_PRICE` were encoded as follow:\n",
    "- `Na` : `0` (absence of warrantly)\n",
    "- `'< 5'` : `1`  \n",
    "- `'5 < 20'` : `2`  \n",
    "- `'20 < 50'` : `3`  \n",
    "- `'50 < 100'` : `4`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Which implies that an order with warrantly price `'50 < 100'` is closer to one with `'20 < 50'` than to another with warantly price `'< 5'`. However, as far as the proportion of claim is concerned, this is not necessarily true. I switched most of the variables encoded this way into a list of rates indicating the proportion of each claim type.\n",
    "Also, some variables such as the `BUYER_AGE`, have a much bigger span the other variables. The $k$-neighbors were therefore often orders made by person with similar age, which is not bad per se, but might not be the most relevant variable to choose from. I did some kind of empirical weighting to improve the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "All these tweaks allowed me to reach rank #4 of the challenge at the time, outclassing Fabien by a significant marging (which is now reversed :'()\n",
    "The features used in the lastest version haven't evolved much since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a significant number of tries, I can say that the rate of correct prediction for claim vs. no-claim seems to top at 65%.\n",
    "For the sake of curiosity, I tried to use a neural network (Keras) with the features used by the Random Forest. The accuracy on the training set progresses slowly to a bit more than 70% with 40 epochs, and the accuracy on the validation seems to get stuck at 64% thus confirming that it will be hard to get more than 65% without adding useful external features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the majority of orders lead to no claim, predicting the presence of a claim correctly is important to get a good AUC score. Predicting the correct type of claim, if any, is of less significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I slightly improved the results by reducing the number of neighbors used to predict the claim type to 1, and using a BaggingClassifier."
